# Evolve

Utilities for converting Ita√∫ credit-card statements from PDF to CSV.

## Development setup

Create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode with the development extras:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This installs `pdfplumber` and all tools required by the CI workflow (pytest, coverage, ruff, black and mypy).
